# OfficeBanao Internship Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is my submission for the Frontend Intern role at OfficeBanao. The assignment involved creating a dynamic screen for work order creation, emphasizing usability and functionality using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Tabs Implementation:**
  - Two main tabs - Overview & Other.
  - Clicking on the 'Other' tab displays a simple "Hello World!" message.

- **Expand/Collapsible Feature:**
  - Implemented a feature to expand/collapse activities or work-items under the Civil package for better organization.

- **Selection Checkboxes:**
  - Checkboxes for selecting/deselecting all work items.
  - Individual checkboxes for granular selection.

- **Save Selection Functionality:**
  - Upon selecting items, the 'Save Selection' button triggers an overlay.
  - Overlay includes fields for client selection (A, B, C dropdown), manual input for commencement/completion dates with format validation, and manual input for RFQ code.
  - Clicking 'Done' prints the input data on the console.
